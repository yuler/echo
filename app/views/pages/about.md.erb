# About

Echo is a personal project for practicing English listening.

It was originally built last year, but I didn't stick with the listening practice mentioned above at the time.

Last year, I spent a lot of time memorizing English words through various Apps([百词斩](https://www.baicizhan.com/), [不背单词](https://bbdc.cn/index)).
But I still couldn't understand spoken English, let alone speak it fluently.

Many people say that if you listen enough, you will naturally learn to pronounce words correctly and speak with confidence.

So, I decided to build a tool to help me practice English listening first.

## Vision

Let's stick with it for a while and see how it goes.
